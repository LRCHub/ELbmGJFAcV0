I am here to show you there is hope in a dying world
And if you don't believe me you won't even see
That what you're living in is hell
You're living in hell
I am here to spread and speak the truth
I am here to heal and do what's right
Dissolving fear, spreading the light
I am here to open and free your mind
Together we travel into realms of evolution
The greatest mystery
We are the fractulated tendrils of this reality
All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality
I am here to show you there is hope in a dying world
I can hear the calling
All my will is bent on change
The universe is ours to rearrange
Follow my lead and in fact you'll see
We create our reality
